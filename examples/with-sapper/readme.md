# Example: Sapper

> **WARNING** Requires Node 7.4 or later â€“ example uses `async` and `await`~!

This example shows you how to use Polkadot programmatically with the default [`sapper-template`](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template/tree/rollup) for Svelte v2 and Rollup.

Even though a [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) server is used in the template by default (which is a great choice! :wink:), using Polkadot may be more appropriate if you are _only_ relying on Sapper's built-in routing.

## Setup

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```


## Usage

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.

Consult [Sapper's website](https://sapper.svelte.technology) for documentation and additional information.
